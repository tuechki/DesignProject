		<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>

		<p>Hopkins was born on New Year's Eve 1937, in Margam, a suburb of Port Talbot, Glamorgan.His parents were Annie Muriel (née Yeates) and Richard Arthur Hopkins, a baker.He stated his father's working-class values have always underscored his life. "Whenever I get a feeling that I may be special or different, I think of my father and I remember his hands – his hardened, broken hands".His school days were unproductive; he would rather immerse himself in art, such as painting and drawing, or playing the piano, than attend to his studies. In 1949, to instill discipline, his parents insisted he attend Jones' West Monmouth Boys' School in Pontypool. He remained there for five terms and was then educated at Cowbridge Grammar School in the Vale of Glamorgan. In a 2002 interview he stated: "I was a poor learner, which left me open to ridicule and gave me an inferiority complex. I grew up absolutely convinced I was stupid."</p>

		<p>Hopkins was inspired by Welsh compatriot Richard Burton, whom he met at the age of 15. Hopkins promptly enrolled at the Royal Welsh College of Music & Drama in Cardiff, from which he graduated in 1957.After two years of his national service, which he served in the British Army, Hopkins moved to London where he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art.</p>

		<h2>Career</h2>

		<p>Hopkins made his first professional stage appearance in the Palace Theatre, Swansea, in 1960 with Swansea Little Theatre's production of Have a Cigarette.In 1965, after several years in repertory, he was spotted by Laurence Olivier, who invited him to join the Royal National Theatre in London. Hopkins became Olivier's understudy, and filled in when Olivier was struck with appendicitis during a 1967 production of August Strindberg's The Dance of Death. Olivier later noted in his memoir, Confessions of an Actor, that:</p>

		<p><i>A new young actor in the company of exceptional promise named Anthony Hopkins was understudying me and walked away with the part of Edgar like a cat with a mouse between its teeth.</i></p>


		<p>Hopkins was nervous prior to going on stage, but since that night he has relaxed, quoting his mentor: "He (Olivier) said: 'Remember: nerves is (sic) vanity – you’re wondering what people think of you; to hell with them, just jump off the edge’. It was great advice.”Despite his success at the National, Hopkins tired of repeating the same roles nightly and yearned to be in films. He made his small-screen debut in a 1967 BBC broadcast of A Flea in Her Ear. His first starring role in a film came in 1964 in Changes, a short directed by Drewe Henley, written and produced by James Scott and co-starring Jacqueline Pearce.In 1968, he got his break in The Lion in Winter playing Richard the Lionheart. Although Hopkins continued in theatre (most notably at the National Theatre as Lambert Le Roux in Pravda by David Hare and Howard Brenton and as Antony in Antony and Cleopatra opposite Judi Dench as well as in the Broadway production of Peter Shaffer's Equus) he gradually moved away from it to become more established as a television and film actor. He portrayed Charles Dickens in the BBC television film The Great Inimitable Mr. Dickens in 1970, and Pierre Bezukhov in the BBC's mini series War and Peace (1972). Making a name for himself as a screen actor, in 1972 he starred as British politician David Lloyd George in Young Winston, and in 1977 he played British Army officer John Frost in the World War II-set film A Bridge Too Far. Both of these films were directed by Richard Attenborough, who described Hopkins as “unquestionably the greatest actor of his generation”.</p>

		<p>In 1978 he starred in the psychological horror film Magic about a demonic ventriloquist's puppet. In 1980, he starred in The Elephant Man as the English doctor Sir Frederick Treves, who attends to Joseph Merrick (portrayed by John Hurt), a severely deformed man in 19th century London. That year he also starred opposite Shirley MacLaine in A Change of Seasons and famously said "she was the most obnoxious actress I have ever worked with."In 1983, Hopkins also became a company member of The Mirror Theater Ltd's Repertory Company. He remained an enthusiastic member of the company and the Mirror's Producing Artistic Director Sabra Jones visited him in London in 1986 to discuss moving Pravda to New York from the National Theatre.[15] In 1984, he starred opposite Mel Gibson in The Bounty as William Bligh, captain of the Royal Navy ship HMS Bounty, in a retelling of the mutiny on the Bounty. In 1992, Hopkins portrayed Professor Van Helsing in Francis Ford Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula.</p>

		<p>Set in 1950s post-war Britain, Hopkins starred opposite Emma Thompson in The Remains of the Day (1993), a film the BFI ranked the 64th greatest British film of the 20th century.Hopkins was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, and he received the BAFTA Award for Best Actor.Hopkins portrayed Oxford academic C. S. Lewis in the 1993 British biographical film Shadowlands, for which he was nominated for a BAFTA Award for Best Actor. During the 1990s, Hopkins had the chance to work with Bart the Bear in two films: Legends of the Fall (1994) and The Edge (1997). According to trainer, Lynn Seus, "Tony Hopkins was absolutely brilliant with Bart...He acknowledged and respected him like a fellow actor. He would spend hours just looking at Bart and admiring him. He did so many of his own scenes with Bart."</p>

		<p>Hopkins was Britain's highest paid performer in 1998, starring in The Mask of Zorro and Meet Joe Black, and also agreed to reprise his role as Dr Hannibal Lecter for a fee of £15 million.In 2000, Hopkins narrated How the Grinch Stole Christmas. Hopkins received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 2003.Hopkins stated that his role as Burt Munro, whom he portrayed in his 2005 film The World's Fastest Indian, was his favourite. He also asserted that Munro was the easiest role that he had played because both men have a similar outlook on life.In 2006, Hopkins was the recipient of the Golden Globe Cecil B. DeMille Award for lifetime achievement. In 2008, he received the BAFTA Academy Fellowship Award, the highest award the British Film Academy can bestow.</p>

		<p>Hopkins portrayed Odin, the Allfather or "king" of Asgard, in the 2011 film adaptation of Marvel Comics' Thor.Hopkins portrayed Alfred Hitchcock in Sacha Gervasi's biopic Hitchcock, following his career while making Psycho. The film was released on 23 November 2012. In 2013, he reprised his role as Odin in Thor: The Dark World and again in 2017's Thor: Ragnarok. In 2014, he portrayed Methuselah in Darren Aronofsky's Noah. Since October 2016, Hopkins has been starring as Robert Ford in the HBO sci-fi series Westworld.

		<h2>Personal Life</h2>

		<p>Hopkins resides in Malibu, California.He had moved to the US once before during the late 1970s to pursue his film career, but returned to London in the late 1980s. However, he decided to return to the US following his 1990s success. Retaining his British citizenship, he became a naturalised US citizen on 12 April 2000, with Hopkins stating: "I have dual citizenship; it just so happens I live in America".</p>

		<p>Hopkins has been married three times: to Petronella Barker from 1966 to 1972; to Jennifer Lynton from 1973 to 2002; and, since 2003, to Stella Arroyave. On Christmas Eve 2012, he celebrated his 10th wedding anniversary by having a blessing at a private service at St David's Cathedral, Pembrokeshire in the most westerly point of Wales. He has a daughter, actress and singer Abigail Hopkins (born 20 August 1969), from his first marriage. The two are estranged, when asked if he had any grandchildren he said, "I don't have any idea. People break up. Families split and, you know, 'Get on with your life.' People make choices. I don't care one way or the other."</p>

		<p>Hopkins is a recovering alcoholic; he has stayed sober since he stopped drinking just after Christmas 1975.He said that 35 years ago, "I made that quantum leap when I asked for help. I just found something and a woman talked to me and she said, just trust in God. And I said, well, why not?" When asked, "did you literally pray?" Hopkins responded: "No, I didn't. I think because I asked for help, which is a form of prayer."In an interview with Larry King in 2016, Hopkins described himself as an agnostic and said "he believed in the power of life" and that there was a "superior consciousness in all of us". He has further explained, "I don't know what I believe, myself personally. … Certainty is the enemy."</p>
